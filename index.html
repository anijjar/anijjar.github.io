                    <p class="lead mb-3">The field of Electrical Engineering is insurmountably large, but the industries I am interested with is electronics and robotics. Specifically, building and testing custom hardware solutions to problems. Recently, I developed a motor controller to supply constant DC current at adjustable voltages to several Blue Robotics ESCs, alongside onboard digital sensors such as the TMP75AIDR temperature sensor and DPS368XTSA1 pressure sensor, to solve the issue of power control and feedback for a robot. </p>
                    <p class="lead mb-3">During Robosub 2023, an international robotics competition, our team's power regulation board died, which would have disqualified us. However, due to my quick thinking, I was able to retrofit our paritally broken, older hardware into the new system by rewriting the firmware and swapping out components. The on-board power regulator was broken, along with the hall sensor detection circuit, both of which I found solutions for.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-3">My most recent employment was at Delta Controls. I performed Black Box Testing For Andrew Swanton and Jack Van Eeden to validate component alternatives to mitigate supply chain disruptions. Other tasks included: automation with Python, external EMC lab testing, Highly Accelerated Lifetime-Testing, and developing test plans for components.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">In my free time, I usually enjoy playing sports and writing code, but recently, I have been getting into making small crafts such as playing card cases. </p>

                                <p>When searching for work, I found myself spending alot of time opening links on the job posting boards to download the PDFs. Since I had exams to study for and other duties, I automated it. It was much later I found out that this is frowned upon ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. It had a simple TKinter GUI that used my ID and password as input. It ran the chrome driver to download postings referencing "electrical", "computer", or "software". The source code can be found on my Github.</p>

                                <p>This project was a requirement from AUVIC, where raw 24VDC needed to be distributed to eight Blue Robotics ESCs. Other requirements included temperature/pressure sensors, PWM output, CAN/USB/UART communication, current feedback, and togglability. My solution included a hardware selectable regulation, where the voltage can be brought down to 12/16/20 volts via jumpers, so that constant voltage can be provided to the speed controllers. A 4 layer stackup was used and the layers were stiched together to provide more copper for the current, also, the top soldermask was removed on the power traces so solder could be applied to decrease hot spots and increase current density. The current feedback can provide information to the on-board microcontroller, which can regulate the delivered current via a N-Channel MOSFET as needed.</p>

                                <p>The Kogge-Stone Adder is a digital arithmetic logic circuit that can perform addition operations with an increased performance by reducing fan-out compared to the Brent-Kung adder, with the cost of more area. Our implementation abstracts the bit size with VHDL, so any size adder can be synthesised, however it should be noted that synthesizing high bit count adders may not be feasible due to the large number of flip flops and wiring required.</p>

                                <div class="subheading mb-3">Capstone Project · Partners: Evan Maier and Avary Newell</div>
                                <p>As a graduation project, our team designed a PCB to drive a three-phase BLDC motor as well as wrote custom firmware. Field-Oriented Control is a variable frequency drive control technique for induction motors by regulating the stator fields to get the maximum torque, while minizing magnetism losses. This can be done on BLDC motors also. By using the rotor position, obtained via back-emf zero-point crossing, an encoder, or hall sensors, the field currents can be manipulated such that the rotor is spinning as smooth as possible. This can be further improved by using space vector PWM, a commutation technique that can drive half-bridge inverters such that the torque ripple is minimized. This project started with a thorough simulation on Simulink with the Motor Control Blockset to determine PI parameters and to check feasibility, then moved forward on hardware/firmware development.</p>
