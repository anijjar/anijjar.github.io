          <p class="mt-2">In 2018, I was accepted into the Computer Engineering program at the University of Victoria. Shortly after, I joined the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Interdisciplinary Club (AUVIC). This experience was my first introduction to PCB design, firmware development, and programming in C++ and Python. I later achieved a leadership role, leading the club for several months, successfully managing projects such as a ROS control system, the mechanical grabber arm, and computer vision development. Currently, I offer consultation and advice to the club members.</p><br>
           
          <p>Upon completing my degree, I achieved my goal of deepening my understanding of robotics and embedded systems. I am now actively seeking to apply these skills to a career in the manufacturing or medical sectors, with a particular interest in hardware development. My strong technical skills, coupled with my project management expertise, position me as a valuable asset in any team.</p><br>
           
          <p>Leading engineering students has highlighted the importance of finding the best solution, rather than striving for perfection. This lesson was learned the hard way during my ECE 200 class when I attempted to overengineer a 3D-printed enclosure. It's a reminder that sometimes, simplicity is the key.</p>

          <p>In 2018, I got enrolled into the Computer Engineering program at the University of Victoria. My goal was to study and learn about robotics and embedded systems.
            
            The field of Electrical Engineering is insurmountably large, but the industries I am interested with is electronics and robotics. Specifically, building and testing custom hardware solutions to problems. Recently, I developed a motor controller to supply constant DC current at adjustable voltages to several Blue Robotics ESCs, alongside onboard digital sensors such as the TMP75AIDR temperature sensor and DPS368XTSA1 pressure sensor, to solve the issue of power control and feedback for a robot.
          </p><br>
          <p>During Robosub 2023, an international robotics competition, our team's power regulation board died, which would have disqualified us. However, due to my quick thinking, I was able to retrofit our paritally broken, older hardware into the new system by rewriting the firmware and swapping out components. The on-board power regulator was broken, along with the hall sensor detection circuit, both of which I found solutions for.
          </p><br>  
          <p>My most recent employment was at Delta Controls. I performed Black Box Testing For Andrew Swanton and Jack Van Eeden to validate component alternatives to mitigate supply chain disruptions. Other tasks included: automation with Python, external EMC lab testing, Highly Accelerated Lifetime-Testing, and developing test plans for components.
          </p><br>  
          <p>In my free time, I usually enjoy playing sports and writing code, but recently, I have been getting into making small crafts such as playing card cases.</p>
